This is my second project about DNN. In this project manage to order people label a crowd counting dataset and get very familiar to tensorflow.

Though still no result. The report is in [github](https://github.com/Jarrome/crowdcounting2017).

But I do learnd. From now on, I start to thinking myself and understanding DNN is not a perfect model.
